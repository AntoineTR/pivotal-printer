Pivotal Printer
===============

## What?

Pivotal printer is a simple _Sinatra_ app that creates handy pdf of your pivotal tracker user stories. You can select to print user stories for a specific sprint or a specific epic!

## Why?

I had to use _Pivotal Tracker_ quite a few times during school and each time I spent about 30 minutes to find back that little piece of code that converted those pivotal csv's that I had to manually export. 

Seeing no one did a simple tool like this, I built it in few hours, there is still place for many improvments, but hey it works!
